		<p class="medium-paragraph">
			Welcome and thank you for your interest. I won't take up too much of your time with a silly intro text, let me get right to the point.

		<p class="medium-paragraph">
			You will find here information on which API's can be detected by the JavaScript Compatibility Checker. I will also give some information on what I have planned for this tool in the future. If you have an idea on how I can make the JSCC even more usefull, please contact me on <a href="https://twitter.com/tbusser">Twitter</a> or create an issue on <a href="https://github.com/tbusser/jscc/issues">GitHub</a>.

		<h2>Roadmap</h2>
		<p class="medium-paragraph">
			What you're looking at is the first version of the JavaScript Compatibility Checker. When I started this website I had a few things in mind that I wanted to accomplish. Enough got done to make it already a useful tool but that doesn't mean it is done. At the moment I have planned the following features to be added:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Load in some polyfills so older browsers will be able to run the site</li>
			<li>Add the ability to filter by browser era so you can limit the report to just, say, the last two versions of each browser</li>
			<li>Allow more than a single file to be selected at a time. Ideally you should be able to select a project and have one report for everything instead of having to check each file seperately</li>
			<li>Add some information in the report on which code triggered the API detection</li>
			<li>Add more links to polyfills and add more APIs to detect</li>
			<li>Add national browser usage figures in addition to the global usage figures</li>
		</ol>
		<p class="medium-paragraph">
			Suggestions on what would make a good addition to the JSCC are always welcome.
